    "HeroHomeSubText": "Gestalt therapy was born in the United States in the 1950s and has been known in Europe since the 1970s. It was Fritz Perls, a German psychologist who developed this therapy whose name Gestalt means in German to take shape, build. Here, we do not wonder why we suffer, but how did we arrive at this suffering and we place the person who comes to consult at the heart of his own reconstruction.",

    "HeroSubText": "This therapy aims not to think of the human being as an individual, but is interested in interactions: the way in which we come into contact with ourselves, with others, but also with the world. If intolerance reigns, if these contacts seem to be blocked, tense, cold, Gestalt therapy aims to restore flexibility because in Gestalt, the person is considered inseparable from his environment. Finally, this therapy also helps to focus on the present. Especially when we are faced with a difficulty. Indeed, rather than looking for the causes of a problem, Gestalt therapy invites the person to ask themselves how: what is the process that led them to this situation. Unlike conventional therapy, there is no need here to look into the past, to reconstruct the person's history, on demand unless the circumstances of the present moment require it.",
    "HeroSubSubText": "Gestalt therapy emphasizes the awareness of the process in progress, which allows the balance between the person who comes to consult and his environment. It is interested in the present of each situation, which is why it is classified in the current of humanistic or existential psychology.",
    "TitleTwo":"The theory of the self",
    "SecondText": "The theory of the self is the basis of Gestalt therapy. The self is  our way of being in the world. Indeed, the Gestalt places the person who comes to consult at the center of his own change, it makes him the main actor. It is therefore a question of improving one's ability to take care of oneself to meet our own needs, but always taking the outside into account. This is the most important thing to understand: in Gestalt therapy, the human being can never be independent of his environment, he is inseparable from what surrounds him, from his environment and he influences it as much as he is. influenced by him. And this is the most important thing to understand:",

    "Point3": "- Accepting to let go, not always wanting to control everything, anticipating. The past no longer exists and the future does not yet exist. Therefore why not focus on the present moment made of surprises and simple happiness.",
    "Point4": "- Favoring positive thoughts because the unconscious is receptive to them and thereby the way of behaving is positively affected."
