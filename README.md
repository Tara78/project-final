# Psychotherapie website
- This is a fullstack project. 
- Client can book an appointment on this website. Clients can log in with their name, email and password if it is a first time visit they can register and book an appointment.  

- After confirming the appointment client has an email as confirmation. 

- Client will have a reminder the day before of visit date by SMS and email. 


## The problem
- The calendar was the most difficult part of this code. Booking a date confirmation and the reminder was not easy either. 

- To solve that problem I embed react-Calendly into my app. I set up all reminders and confirmations by email and SMS on the Calendly setting.  
And used the URL which I created in the Calendly event and render it on the booking page.
